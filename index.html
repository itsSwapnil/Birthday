      <h2>Birthday message</h2>
      <p>To Akshu❤️, Another year older, but still the dumbest person I know! 🤣 From calling yourself a panda to me knowing you’re actually a Mhaiss, you’ve truly mastered the art of being adorably annoying. 😆 But jokes aside, you’re someone who makes life a whole lot more fun. Hope your day is filled with all the things you love—cake, happiness, and, of course, ME! 😎 Stay crazy, stay awesome, and get ready for another year of me tolerating you. 😜❤️ And no matter how much I tease you, I know that together, we’ll keep pushing each other, growing stronger, and making all our dreams come true. 💫💖</p>

          <small>15th of November 2022</small>
          <p>I’m not entirely sure about the exact date, but I know it was around that time. We met at the office, and from there, you started teaching me about work—those late-night shift KTs, the craziest moments! Who knew that all those silly, idiotic things would grow into something this strong? And now, here we are, bound together in an unbreakable bond.!!</p>

          <small>28th of June 2023</small>
          <p>After almost six months, we finally met again—and let’s be real, I came just for you! ❤️ That whole month was absolutely crazy—we went on a trip, made unforgettable memories, and you gave me the best birthday celebration I’ve ever had. We danced, we drank, we laughed—it was truly one of the best times of my life.

            Thank you for every moment! 💖</p>

          <h2>The Moment That Stayed With Me</h2>
          <small>22nd of September 2024</small>
          <p>We met again after a year, and nothing had changed between us—except that we had grown even closer. That time was one of the best moments of my life, and I hope it was for you too. We shared memories so special that only we truly understand them.

            Now, it’s March 21st, almost seven months since we last met, and I still remember those days in vivid detail. If I had the power back then, I would have never let you go. But it’s okay—because I know we’ll meet again soon to create even more unforgettable memories! ❤️</p>
